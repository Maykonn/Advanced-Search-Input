## üìò Detailed Feature Guide
### USER-FRIENDLY SEARCH INTERFACE
Smart Search Bar: Users can type complex queries in a single, easy-to-use input field.
Intelligent Suggestions: As users type, the system suggests relevant search terms, making it easier to build complex queries.
Help at Your Fingertips: A convenient help icon provides instant access to search tips and available options.

### POWERFUL AND FLEXIBLE SEARCH CAPABILITIES

```

### CUSTOMIZABLE DATE AND TIME SEARCHES
Calendar Integration: User-friendly calendar for easy date selection in date-based searches.
Date Range Queries: Find items within specific time periods.
Example:
```txt
created_at >= "2023-01-01" AND created_at < "2023-12-31"
```

### RESULT MANAGEMENT AND DISPLAY
Flexible Sorting: Arrange search results based on multiple criteria.
Customizable Order: Choose ascending or descending order for each sorting option.
Pagination Control: Specify the number of results per page and easily navigate through large result sets.
Example:
```txt
ORDER BY created_at DESC, username ASC LIMIT 20 OFFSET 40
```

### USER-CENTRIC FEATURES
Query Saving and Sharing: Searches are automatically saved in the URL for easy bookmarking and sharing.
Quick Reset: A 'Clear Query' button allows users to start a new search instantly.
Mobile-Friendly Design: The search interface adapts to various screen sizes for a consistent experience across devices.

### RELATION-BASED SEARCHES
Connected Data Queries: Search for items based on related information.
Multi-Level Relationships: Perform searches spanning multiple levels of connected data.
Example:
```txt
users.posts.comments.author = "jane_doe" AND users.posts.title ~ "important"
```

## üé® Customization
### VISUAL CUSTOMIZATION
Tailor the look and feel to match your application:
```js
AdvancedSearch.init({
    // ... other options
    customHTML: `
        <div class="custom-search-wrapper">
            <input type="text" id="search-input" placeholder="Search...">
            <button id="search-button">Search</button>
            <button id="clear-button">Clear</button>
            <span id="help-icon">?</span>
        </div>
    `
});
```
### FUNCTIONAL CUSTOMIZATION
Adapt the search behavior to your specific needs:
```js
AdvancedSearch.init({
    // ... other options
    successCallback: (message, data) => {
        console.log("Search successful:", message);
        displayResults(data);
    },
    errorCallback: (message, data) => {
        console.error("Search failed:", message);
        showErrorNotification(data);
    }
});
```

## üîå API Integration
Connect the search input to your backend API:
```js
AdvancedSearch.init({
    // ... other options
    searchAPI: '/api/v2/advanced-search'
});
```
The API will receive requests with the following structure:
```txt
GET /api/v2/advanced-search?filter={"filters":[...],"sort":[...],"limit":20,"offset":40}
```
Example API request for a simple query:
```txt
GET /api/v2/advanced-search?filter={"filters":[{"property":"username","operator":"~","value":"john","andor":null}],"sort":[],"limit":null,"offset":null}
```txt
JSON structure for the filter parameter:
```json
{
  "filters": [
    {
      "property": "username",
      "operator": "~",
      "value": "john",
      "andor": null
    }
  ],
  "sort": [],
  "limit": null,
  "offset": null
}
```
For a more complex query:
```txt
GET /api/v2/advanced-search?filter={"filters":[{"property":"username","operator":"~","value":"john","andor":null},{"property":"email","operator":"=","value":"john@example.com","andor":"or"}],"sort":[{"property":"created_at","direction":"DESC"}],"limit":20,"offset":0}
```
```json
{
  "filters": [
    {
      "property": "username",
      "operator": "~",
      "value": "john",
      "andor": null
    },
    {
      "property": "email",
      "operator": "=",
      "value": "john@example.com",
      "andor": "or"
    }
  ],
  "sort": [
    {
      "property": "created_at",
      "direction": "DESC"
    }
  ],
  "limit": 20,
  "offset": 0
}
```
**Your backend should parse this query string and return the appropriate results based on your data structure and business logic.**

## üöÄ Advanced Usage
### COMPLEX RELATIONAL QUERIES
```js
// Find users who have posted articles about 'JavaScript' and received comments from 'Jane'
const query = 'users.posts.title ~ "JavaScript" AND users.posts.comments.author = "Jane"';

// Find products with high-rated reviews from verified purchasers
const query = 'products.reviews.rating > 4 AND products.reviews.verified_purchase = true';
```
### ADVANCED DATE AND TIME QUERIES
```js
// Find users who registered in 2023 and have been active in the last 30 days
const query = 'users.created_at >= "2023-01-01" AND users.created_at < "2024-01-01" AND users.last_login > "2023-12-01"';

// Find posts created on weekends
const query = 'posts.created_at.dayOfWeek in (1, 7)';

// Find events scheduled for next month
const query = 'events.date >= "2024-02-01" AND events.date < "2024-03-01"';
```
### PAGINATION AND SORTING
```js
// Find the top 10 most commented posts from the last week, sorted by comment count
const query = 'posts.created_at > "2024-01-14" ORDER BY posts.comments.count DESC LIMIT 10';

// Get the second page of users, sorted by registration date
const query = 'ORDER BY users.created_at DESC LIMIT 20 OFFSET 20';

// Complex sorting across multiple entities
const query = 'ORDER BY users.reputation DESC, users.posts.views DESC, users.posts.comments.count DESC LIMIT 15';
```
### COMBINING MULTIPLE ENTITY SEARCHES WITH COMPLEX CONDITIONS
```js
// Find high-value customers who have made large purchases and left positive reviews
const query = '(users.total_spent > 1000 OR users.orders.count > 10) AND users.reviews.rating > 4';

// Find controversial posts with many comments but low ratings
const query = 'posts.comments.count > 50 AND posts.average_rating < 3 ORDER BY posts.comments.count DESC';
```
### USING MULTIPLE LOGICAL OPERATORS
```js
// Find active users who are either premium members or have made a purchase in the last month
const query = 'users.is_active = true AND (users.membership_type = "premium" OR users.last_purchase_date > "2023-12-15")';

// Find products that are either out of stock or low in inventory, and have high demand
const query = '(products.stock_count = 0 OR products.stock_count < products.reorder_level) AND products.demand_score > 8';
```
### NESTED RELATIONAL QUERIES
```js
// Find authors who have books with chapters that mention "artificial intelligence"
const query = 'authors.books.chapters.content ~ "artificial intelligence"';

// Find departments with employees who have completed projects ahead of schedule
const query = 'departments.employees.projects.completion_date < departments.employees.projects.deadline';
```
These examples demonstrate the versatility and power of the Advanced Search Input package. Users can create highly specific and complex queries to extract precisely the information they need, enhancing the overall functionality and user experience of your application.

## üß™ Executing Tests
The Advanced Search Input package includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure its functionality. To run the tests:
1) Enable test mode in your initialization:
```js
AdvancedSearch.init({
    // ... other options
    testMode: true,
    runTests: true
});
```
2) Optionally, you can specify which tests to run:
```js
AdvancedSearch.init({
    // ... other options
    testMode: true,
    runTests: true,
    testIds: [1, 7, 14] // Run only tests with these IDs
});
```
Check the console for test results. Each test will output whether it passed or failed, along with details of any failures.

                let html = '<h2>Search Results</h2><ul>';
                data.forEach(item => {
                    html += `<li>${item.username} - ${item.email}</li>`;
                });
                html += '</ul>';

            }
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
This example sets up an advanced search for users, their posts, and comments. After installed you may try queries like:
```txt
username ~ "john" AND posts.title ~ "important" AND posts.comments.content ~ "great" ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10
```
